hail:|:Falling ice in roughly round shapes at least 0 2 of an inch in diameter Hail comes from thunderstorms and is larger than sleet Hailstones form when upward moving air -- updrafts -- in a thunderstorm keep pieces of graupel from falling Drops of supercooled water hit and freeze to the graupel, causing it to grow When the balls of ice become too heavy for the updrafts to continue supporting them, they fall as hailstones Sleet, in contrast, consists of raindrops that freeze on the way down.
hail:|:fence. enclosure.
hail:|:Hail is a destructive form of precipitation that is 5 to 190 millimeters in diameter The large downdrafts in mature thunderstorm clouds provide the mechanism for hail formation Hailstones normally have concentric shells of ice alternating between those with a milky appearance and those that are clear The milky white shells, containing bubbles and partially melted snowflakes, correspond to a period of rapid freezing, while the clear shells develop as the liquid water freezes much more slowly.

hail:|:Precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice Tall cumulonimbus clouds are much warmer at the bottom than at the top This causes tremendous pressure differences and strong rising air currents, which suck warm water droplets from the bottom of the clouds to the top There, they freeze If the currents are strong enough, a hailstone will fall and rise many times, causing several layers of ice to build up until the hailstone is heavy enough to fall from the cloud.
hail:|:Precipitation in the form of balls or lumps usually consisting of concentric layers of ice A thunderstorm is classified as severe when it produces hail 3/4 of an inch or larger in diameter The following table shows hail size estimates:. is precipitation composed of lumps of ice Hail is produced when large frozen raindrops or other particles in cumulonimbus clouds, grow by accumulating supercooled liquid droplets Violent updrafts in the cloud carry the particles up through the freezing all; allowing the frozen core to accumulate more ice when the piece of hail becomes too heavy to be carried by rising air currents, it falls to the ground.
