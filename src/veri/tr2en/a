arp:|:The protocol that translates Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses into physical network addresses One of the many members of the TCP/IP protocol suite, ARP is a key player in the process that allows a packet of data addressed to a particular Internet host to find its destination See also DNS, RARP, and TCP/IP. - A TCP/IP protocol used to obtain a node\s physical address when only its logical IP address is known An ARP request with the IP address is broadcast onto the network, and the node with that address responds by sending back its hardware address so that packets can be transmitted The protocol translates IP addresses into physical network addresses, such as Ethernet IDs, by converting the 32-bit IP addresses into the 48-bit physical network Ethernet addresses Another TCP/IP protocol which plays a less visible, but equally important role in the operation of TCP/IP networks Reverse ARP, or RARP, is used by a diskless workstation to obtain its logical IP address.
