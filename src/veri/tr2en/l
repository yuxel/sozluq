lens:|:A cylinder of shaped pieces of glass or plastic at the front of a camera, the lens projects a tiny image of the subject onto the film.
lens:|:A lens is a clear object which changes the direction of light beams passing through it There is a part of the eyeball called the lens, which focuses light on the retina Corrective lenses, such as contact lenses and eyeglass lenses, change the direction of incoming light so that a clear image appears on the retina and you can see clearly.
lens:|:A medium which will bend light The eye has its own crystalline lens that helps focus light Spectacle lenses help bend the light in such a way that once it reaches the eye it can then be focused Contact lenses do the same except that they are in contact with the eyeball.
lens:|:An optical device made of glass or other transparent material that forms images by bending and focusing rays of light A lens made of a single piece of glass cannot produce very sharp or exact images, so camera lenses are made up of a number of glass \elements\ that cancel out each other\s weaknesses and work together to give a sharp true image The size, curvature and positioning of the elements determine the focal length and angle of view of a lens.
lens:|:A piece of glass, or other transparent substance, ground with two opposite regular surfaces, either both curved, or one curved and the other plane, and commonly used, either singly or combined, in optical instruments, for changing the direction of rays of light, and thus magnifying objects, or otherwise modifying vision.
lens:|:A structure inside the eye that helps to focus light on the retina It is curved on both sides and acts similar to a camera lens. a transparent optical element, so constructed that it serves to change the degree of convergence or divergence of the transmitted rays. is a part of the eye that provides some focusing power The lens is able to change shape allowing the eye to focus at different distances.

lens:|:The crystalline lens finishes the focusing of light It helps to \fine tune\ vision, and it is able to change shape to allow the eye to focus on near objects When it becomes cloudy, it is called a cataract Unlike the cornea, the lens can be made to change its shape rapidly and voluntarily Using its ability to change shape, the lens allows the eye to change its focal point Changes in the shape of the lens will allow a normal eye to focus on near objects.
lens:|:The crystalline lens of the eye is located behind the pupil and iris of the eye and its job is to flex and bend to help focus the light coming in The lens relaxes and contracts when focused at near and far distances to apply more or less \zoom\ power in order to see object clearly This structure is generally quite clear and cannot be seen without special equipment If it gets cloudy, we refer to this as a \cataract \ SEE: ACCOMMODATION.
lens:|:The glass or plastic element through which light first enters your camera If you have a poor-quality lens, it doesn\t matter how many megapixels or other features a camera has, the picture will be poor Plastic lenses can make your photo look as though they were taken on a foggy day Aspherical glass lenses produce better pictures by reducing the slight distortion often caused by circular lenses.
lens:|:The lens sits in the middle of the eye, behind the pupil It focuses the light onto the retina so that you see clear images The lens is a remarkable instrument that adjusts from reading fine print to reading a movie marquee 100 or more feet away Tiny ligaments keep the lens suspended in place.
lens:|:The part of the eye behind the iris that adjusts focus for different distances by changing shape.
