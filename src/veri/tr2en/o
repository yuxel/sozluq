ole:|:Object Linking and Embedding A feature of windows that allows information to be shared between applications as objects.
ole:|:Object Linking and Embedding A Microsoft Corp software technology that allows Windows programs to exchange information and work together For instance, a word processing document with OLE capabilities could contain a link to a chart created in a spreadsheet Version 2 0 of OLE was released in the Windows 95 operating system OLE means tying one piece of information in one form into a document in another form, such that a change in one piece of information will be automatically reflected in the other document.
