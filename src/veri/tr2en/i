İsa:|:Acronym for Industry Standard Architecture Refers to hardware compatibility with the original IBM-compatible machines IBM PS2 machines with the microchannel bus do not follow this system, so they require special accessory cards An ISA machine will accept any ISA or original IBM-compatible accessory card Not all IBM-compatible machines are ISA Packard-Bell, Compaq and several other machines have \proprietary\ boards that can cause compatibility problems.

İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture - ISA is a standard bus architecture that is associated with the IBM AT motherboard It allows 16 bits at a time to flow between the motherboard circuitry and an expansion slot card and its associated device.
İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture One standard for IBM and compatible computers that specifies the architecture of the hardware. The original form of ISA was a simple and slow 8-bit bus used on IBM PCs Eventually, the ISA connector was stretched to allow 16-bits of data to pass through each clock cycle, bringing its speed to between 8 and 10 MHz ISA slots are used to connect expansion boards to the motherboard.
İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture PC bus type 16 bits.
İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture The bus design of the IBM PC/XT which enables various adapters to be added to the system by means of inserting plug-in cards into expansion slots.
İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture The original specification for the EXPANSION SLOTS used on the first IBM PC Nowadays replaced by its successor - the PCI SLOT.
İsa:|:Industry Standard Architecture This is standard, although now rather dated, data bus interface for system components such as floppy disk drivers.
İsa:|:Interim Stowage Assembly As indicated in the diagram, the ISA is a set of stowage bags on a framework that fits over the Commander\s PLSS when the latter is mounted on the wall behind the CDR\s left shoulder An ISA can be seen on the left at Neil Armstrong\s back in Apollo 11 training photo KSC-69PC-319 When the PLSS is in use, the ISA is put somewhere out of the way and, for the return to lunar orbit, it is attached to the aft bulkhead Journal Contributor David Woods notes that after rendezvous with the Command Module, the ISA is transferred over, probably without the framework, for return to Earth.
İsa:|:ISA is the 16-bit bus architecture used in the older IBM PC/XT and PC/AT PCs, and the AT version of this bus became the industry standard Starting in the early 90s, ISA began to be replaced by the PCI local bus architecture.
İsa:|:ISA is the Industry Standard Architecture for system buses In the early 1990\s, ISA PCI local bus architecture started replacing ISA Most computers today do not include the ISA bus.
İsa:|:The bus architecture used in the IBM PC/XT and PC/AT It\s often abbreviated as ISA bus The AT version of the bus is called the AT bus and became a de facto industry standard Starting in the early 90s, ISA began to be replaced by the PCI local bus architecture Most computers made today include both an AT bus for slower devices and a PCI bus for devices that need better bus performance In 1993, Intel and Microsoft introduced a new version of the ISA specification called Plug and Play ISA Plug and Play ISA enables the operating system to configure expansion boards automatically so that users do not need to fiddle with DIP switches and jumpers.
İsa:|:The bus architecture used in the IBM PC/XT and PC/AT It\s often abbreviated as ISA bus The AT version of the bus is called the AT bus and has become a de facto industry standard Since the late 80s, the industry has been searching for a successor to the ISA bus, which is not sufficient for modern devices and applications It now appears that the successor will be the PCI local bus architecture Most computers made today include both an AT bus for slower devices and a local bus for devices that need better bus performance.
