radar:|:System using pulsed radio waves to detect the position of objects by measuring the time a single pulse takes to reach the object and be reflected back.
radar:|:Term coined from the phrase \Radio Detecting and Ranging \ It is based on the principle that ultra-high frequency radio waves travel at a precise speed and are reflected from objects they strike It is used to determine an object\s direction and distance. an electronic instrument that broadcasts and receives microwave signals back from precipitation areas, and determines their location, height, movement, and intensity rainbow: an arc displaying all colors in the visible light spectrum Formed when light from the sun is reflected and refracted through water droplets Always appears on the side of the sky opposite of the sun reflectivity: a measure of how well a surface turns the part of the radiation it receives back in the direction from which the radiation came refraction: bending of light as it passes through something with different properties, such as a light beam bending as it travels through glass relative humidity: ratio of the actual vapor pressure of the air to the saturation vapor pressure for the surrounding air temperature In other words, how much water the air is holding divided by how much water the air is capable of holding.
