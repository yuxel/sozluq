nas:|:An architecture for attaching a shared disk storage device to a server, which relies on an Ethernet LAN to make the connection.
nas:|:A network-attached storage device is a server that is dedicated to nothing more than file sharing NAS does not provide any of the activities that a server in a server-centric system typically provides, such as e-mail, authentication or file management NAS allows more hard disk storage space to be added to a network that already utilizes servers without shutting them down for maintenance and upgrades With a NAS device, storage is not an integral part of the server Instead, in this storage-centric design, the server still handles all of the processing of data but a NAS device delivers the data to the user A NAS device does not need to be located within the server but can exist anywhere in a LAN and can be made up of multiple networked NAS devices.
