cop:|:Coefficient Of Performance A ratio that compares a heat pump system\s heating efficiency to that of electric resistance heat For example, a heat pump system with a COP of 3 0 provides heat at 3 times the efficiency of electric resistance heat A heat pump\s system COP will decrease as outdoor temperatures drop, eventually providing little or no efficiency advantage over electric resistance heat - and that\s when your auxiliary heat strips start to heat your home.
cop:|:Coefficient Of Performance compares the heating capacity of a heat pump to the amount of electricity required to operate the heat pump in the heating mode COPs vary with the outside temperature: as the temperature falls, the COP falls also, since the heat pump is less efficient at lower temperatures.
cop:|:Coefficient Of Performance compares the heating capacity of a heat pump to the amount of electricity required to operate the heat pump in the heating mode COPs vary with the outside temperature: as the temperature falls, the COP falls also, since the heat pump is less efficient at lower temperatures ARI standards compare equipment at two temperatures, 47 F and 17 F, to give you an idea of the COP in both mild and colder temperatures.

cop:|:Coefficient of Performance, COP, is the ratio of energy input to heating capacity This is the instantaneous measurement of the heating performance of your heat pump It is comparable to knowing how many miles per gallon of gasoline your car gets when it is going full speed You can find the COP on the nameplate of your heat pump.
