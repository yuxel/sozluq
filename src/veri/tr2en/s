san:|:Storage Area Network A back-end network connecting storage devices via peripheral channels such as SCSI, SSA, ESCON and Fibre Channel There are two ways of implementing SANs: centralized and decentralized A centralized SAN ties multiple hosts into a single storage system, which is a RAID device with large amounts of cache and redundant power supplies The cabling distances allow for local as well as campus-wide and metropolitan-wide hookups over peripheral channels rather than an overburdened network SCSI distances have also been extended Using fiber, Gigalabs\ SCSI switches can communicate over 20 km This centralized storage topology is commonly employed to tie a server cluster together for failover.
san:|:Storage Area Network, a highly scalable, managed storage infrastructure for gigabit device-level data connections that can offer high system availability, extensive fault tolerance, and low cost of ownership.

san:|:Storage Area Network cf DAS and NAS.
san:|:Storage Area Network is a high-speed subnetwork of shared storage devices A storage device is a machine that contains nothing but a disk or disks for storing data A SAN\s architecture works in a way that makes all storage devices available to all servers on a LAN or WAN As more storage devices are added to a SAN, they too will be accessible from any server in the larger network In this case, the server merely acts as a pathway between the end user and the stored data Because stored data does not reside directly on any of a network\s servers, server power is utilized for business applications, and network capacity is released to the end user.
