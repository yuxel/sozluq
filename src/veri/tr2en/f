fiber:|:An optical fiber transmits information using light waves, rather than electrons as in copper wires An optical fiber consists of a thin core, which carries the light signal, surrounded by a thicker transparent cladding, which keeps the light within the core Typically, a fiber core is made of glass, but plastics are used for short distance applications The fiber is protected by a soft buffer, which, in turn, is protected by a hard jacket Several fibers may be bundled into a single jacket Light-emitting diodes or lasers transmit light through the fiber core See Multimode Fiber, Single-Mode Fiber. fiber is an ingredient in edible plants that aids in digestion Fiber helps keep the stool soft, and keeps it traveling easily through the intestine Fiber is found in vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains.
