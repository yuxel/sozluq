delta:|:The amount by which an option\s price will change for a one-point change in price by the underlying entity Call options have positive deltas, while put options have negative deltas Technically, the delta is an instantaneous measure of the option\s price change, so that the delta will be altered for even fractional changes by the underlying entity See also Hedge Ratio.

delta:|:The change in the value of the option premium made fully paid by the capitalisation of reserves and given relative to the instantaneous change in the value of the; underlying instrument, expressed as a coefficient. An alluvial deposit made of rock particles dropped by a stream as it enters a body of water A plain underlain by an assemblage of sediments that accumulate where a stream flows into a body of standing water where its velocity and transporting power are suddenly reduced Originally so named because many deltas are roughly triangular in plan, like the Greek letter delta , with the apex pointing upstream. measures the change in the value of the reserves portfolios for each one basis point shift in the relevant yield curve.

delta:|:The low, nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at or near the mouth of a river, commonly forming a triangular or fan-shaped plain of considerable area, crossed by many distributaries of the main river, perhaps extending beyond the general trend of the coast, and resulting from the accumulation of sediment supplied by the river in such quantities that it is not removed by tides, waves, and currents Most deltas are partly subaerial and partly below the water The term was introduced by Herodotus in the 5th Century B C for the tract of land, at the mouth of the Nile River, whose outline broadly resembled the Greek capital letter \delta\:|:D , with the apex pointing upstream.
